git_demo Repository
📖 Overview
Welcome to the git_demo repository! This repository is designed to demonstrate the basics of Git and GitHub workflows, including branching, committing, merging, and collaboration. Inside this repo, you'll find the Workbooks directory, which contains interactive workbooks and resources for learning and experimenting with data analysis, coding, and more.

📂 Workbooks Directory
The Workbooks directory is a collection of interactive workbooks that can be used for various purposes, such as:

Learning Git and GitHub workflows through practical examples.
Experimenting with data analysis using tools like Quadratic, Jupyter Notebooks, or Excel.
Storing educational resources for coding, data science, or collaborative projects.
What's Inside?
Git Tutorials: Step-by-step guides on using Git commands (e.g., git clone, git commit, git branch).
Data Analysis Workbooks: Examples of data analysis workflows, potentially using tools like Quadratic (a modern spreadsheet tool) or Python-based Jupyter Notebooks.
Sample Projects: Small projects to practice Git collaboration and version control.

이 README는 git_demo 레포지토리의 목적과 Workbooks 디렉토리의 역할을 설명하며, 사용자가 쉽게 시작할 수 있도록 안내합니다. 추가적인 세부 사항(예: 특정 워크북 파일 이름이나 사용된 도구)이 있다면 알려주시면 내용을 더 구체적으로 수정할 수 있습니다!







이거 마크업 랭귀지 형식으로 다시써줘 그냥 붙여넣기해서 쓰게




아래는 이전에 작성한 README 내용을 Markdown 형식으로 다시 작성한 것입니다. Markdown은 GitHub에서 README 파일을 작성할 때 가장 널리 사용되는 마크업 언어로, 그대로 복사해서 GitHub 레포지토리의 README.md 파일에 붙여넣으면 바로 적용됩니다.
